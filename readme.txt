== Description ==
This integration enables you to use your WooCommerce store as a multichannel order management system. In addition to tracking orders placed directly on your store, the extension imports orders from other platforms and marketplaces, including Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Overstock, and Etsy. After you fulfill an order by providing tracking information, the extension sends this data to the relevant marketplace, marking the order as shipped. This allows you to manage all your orders from within the WooCommerce interface.

* This extension is compatible with WooCommerce Shipment Tracking and WooCommerce Shipping & Tax plugins.
* The integration automatically imports orders from marketplaces such as Walmart, Amazon, eBay, Overstock, and Etsy to your WooCommerce store.

* When you fulfill an order in WooCommerce, the integration automatically submits tracking information to the relevant marketplace.

* Support is available via email and live chat.
